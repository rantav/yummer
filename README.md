Yummer is a simple java interface to various yum functionalities.
Currently only the search functionality is implemented

It's a toy project. I only implemented what I needed (Search multiple yum repositories for a certain package). It's not terribly hard to add more functionality such as install/remove etc but I didn't need it so it's not there. yet...
